GSoc-BMS is a user-friendly platform for students to interact and share their
grievances with the management committee of BMSIT Bangalore by uploading it in
the form of petitions to the associated departments.

This application allows its users to check the real-time status of the petitions filed
regarding any academic or non-academic issue that the individual is facing. At the
same time, it also enables the admin (college administration) to respond to the
petition uploaded by the user and update the status of the petition in the order:
PENDING -> IN PROGRESS -> RESOLVED.

The app also provides a ‘Security Alert’ feature which enables the user to send a
distress signal whenever the individual faces some kind of threat. Using this
feature, the user can notify others (students & college administration) about the
same by sending their current location with the help of the app and thus, ensure
their safety on and off the college campus!

Overall, GSocBMS provides a more efficient process for dealing with our day-to-day
problems on campus and makes the process of dealing with such grievances much
simpler.
